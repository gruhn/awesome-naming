> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.
> 
> ― Phil Karlton

Concepts in computer science are usually nothing tangible so it's no surprise that naming things is hard.
Nevertheless, we _do_ come up with clever, creative and funny names.
Some of them so established, we never pause and admire.

This is a curated list for when naming things is done right.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

- [Backtracking](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) - When you explore a search space and you reach a dead end, you follow your *tracks* back to the last crossroad and try the other way. 
- [Brute force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search) - Violence is actually almost always a solution but not a very clever one.
- [Greedy algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) - An algorithm that finds a solution by always picking the currently best looking option without thinking too much about past and future decisions.
- [Hill climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing) - Starting somewhere in the hilly "landscape" of solutions you go in the direction of steepest ascent until reaching the top of a hill. You might miss higher hills though. 
- [Israeli Queue](https://rapidapi.com/blog/israeli-queues-exploring-a-bizarre-data-structure/) - A type of priority queue and a reference to the infamously unorganized queues in Israel. Here items can *cut in line* when they *have already waiting friends*.
- [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) - Like with a stack of pancakes you can only add and remove items from the top of this data structure.
- [Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) - A hierarchically organized data structure. From the _root_ item the other items _branch out_ into _nodes_ and _leaves_. A collection of trees is often called a *forest*.
- [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) - In this data structure items are always added at the end and removed at the front as if the items were waiting in line.

## Design Patterns and Anti Patterns

- [Facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) - Analogous to a facade in architecture, a facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying structure.
- [Promise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises) - A representation of a result that is available in the future, unless there are errors. Like in reality, promises are broken sometimes.
- [Shotgun surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_surgery) - A programming antipattern where in a single change you wildly add code everywhere in your codebase.
- [Spaghetti Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code) - A program with a tangled and hard-to-follow stucture.

## Functions

- [munch](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.19.0.0/docs/Text-ParserCombinators-ReadP.html#v:munch) - Parser function that greedily consumes an input stream until it's satisfied.
- [trampoline](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/trampoline) - Continuously runs functions which itself return functions. Like a child on a trampoline that _returns_ and bounces back up.

- [Phoning home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoning_home) - When a system (e.g. stolen computer) secretly reports back to a third party other than the current possessor. The name is a reference to the movie E.T.
- [Sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)) - A safe and isolated environment to test unverified programs that may contain malicious code.
- [Trojan horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)) - Malware which misleads users of its true intent. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse. 

## Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

- [Confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) - A tabular summary of a classifiers "confusion", i.e. how often it thought to make correct predictions when it actually didn't.
- [Decision boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_boundary) - A boundary dividing the space of possible data points. Here you decide, everything on this side is SPAM, everything on that side is not.
- [Gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) - Minimizing a cost function by iteratively computing the gradient and moving in the direction of steepest descent. 
- [Hallucination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)) - A confident response by an AI that does not seem to be justified by its training data.

- [Lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation) - An evaluation stategy which suspends evaluation until it's absolutely necessary and then never does it again.
- [Syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) - Syntax that makes the language "sweeter" for human use. Usually a shorthand for common operations that can also be expressed in a more verbose form.
