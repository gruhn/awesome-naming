> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.
> 
> ― Phil Karlton

Concepts in computer science are usually nothing tangible so it's no surprise that naming things is hard.
Nevertheless, we _do_ come up with clever, creative and funny names.
Some of them so established, we never pause and admire.

This is a curated list for when naming things is done right.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

- [Greedy algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) - An algorithm that finds a solution by always picking the currently best looking option without thinking too much about past and future decisions.
- [Israeli Queue](https://rapidapi.com/blog/israeli-queues-exploring-a-bizarre-data-structure/) - A type of priority queue and a reference to the infamously unorganized queues in Israel. Here items can *cut in line* when they *have already waiting friends*.
- [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) - Like with a stack of pancakes you can only add and remove items from the top of this data structure.
- [Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) - A hierarchically organized data structure. From the _root_ item the other items _branch out_ into _nodes_ and _leaves_.
- [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) - In this data structure items are always added at the end and removed at the front as if the items were waiting in line.

## Design Patterns and Anti Patterns

- [Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) - Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.
- [Facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) - Analogous to a facade in architecture, a facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying structure.
- [Promise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises) - A representation of a result that is available in the future, unless there are errors. Like in reality, promises are broken sometimes.
- [Shotgun surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_surgery) - A programming anitpattern where in a single change you wildly add code everywhere in your codebase.

## Functions

- [fold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)) - Like a blanket being folded up, this function iterates a collection and in each step combines the current item with everything that has already been folded.
- [trampoline](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/trampoline) - Continuously runs functions which itself return functions. Like a child on a trampoline that _returns_ and bounces back up. 
- [zip](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:zip) - Merges two lists into one list of pairs like the interlocking teeth of a zipper.

## IT Security

- [Backdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)) - A method of bypassing normal authentication in a computer system.
- [Computer virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus) - A computer program that self replicates by _infecting_ other computer programs similar to the behavior of biological viruses.
- [Cyber hygiene](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-cyber-hygiene-definition-cyber-hygiene-benefits-best-practices-and-more) - Steps and practices that users should take to maintain system health and improve online security.
- [Honeypot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)) - Part of a system meant to look like an attractive target but actually helps detect and deflect attackers.
- [Phoning home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoning_home) - When a system (e.g. stolen computer) secretly reports back to a third party other than the current possessor. The name is a reference to the movie E.T.
- [Sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)) - A safe and isolated environment to test unverified programs that may contain malicious code.
- [Trojan horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)) - Malware which misleads users of its true intent. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse. 

## Libraries and Frameworks

- [clooney](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/clooney) - A JavaScript library implementing the actor model for concurrent computation. The term is a reference to George Clooney who is also an actor.
- [uppy](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy) - A dog themed uploader component. The name is a blend of _upload_ and _puppy_. It even comes with a crash recovery plugin called _golden retreiver_.

## Machine Learning

- [Decision boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_boundary) - A boundary dividing the space of possible data points. Here you decide, everything on this side is SPAM, everything on that side is not. 

## User Interface Elements

- [Breadcrumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_(navigation)) - Navigational aid allowing users to keep track of their location within programs, documents, or websites. The term is a reference to the fairy tale _Hansel and Gretel_.
- [Carousel](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/designing-effective-carousels/) - A kind of animated slideshow looping back on itself.
- [Desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_metaphor) - The metaphorical top of the user's desk, upon which objects such as documents and folders of documents can be placed.
- [Hamburger button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button) - A button to toggle a menu. The associated icon resembles a hamburger.

## Theoretical Computer Science

- [Clique problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem) - The problem of finding groups of mutual friends in a network of people with friendship relations. Or more general, finding complete subgraphs.
- [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) - A game without players and nearly no rules which nevertheless produces astonishing complexity.

## Other

- [ACID vs. BASE](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/07/06/brewer-cap-theorem-base/) - Acronyms describing competing database ideologies (aka. SQL vs. NoSQL). 
- [camelCase, snake_case, kebab-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles) - Different case styles where the name illustrates its appearance.
- [Easter egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)) - A hidden feature especially in video games in reference to the Easter egg hunt.
- [Glue Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glue_code) - Jenga and LEGO bricks don't share the same interface but you can always glue them together.
- [Lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation) - An evaluation stategy which suspends evaluation until it's absolutly necessary and then never does it again.
- [Optimistic UI](https://uxplanet.org/optimistic-1000-34d9eefe4c05) - User interfaces that assume expensive operations will complete successfully thereby improving the perceived performance.
- [Process starvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science)) - A problem where a process is perpetually denied resources to do its work.
- [Time travel debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel_debugging) - Stepping back in time through source code to understand execution and sometimes even to change history.
