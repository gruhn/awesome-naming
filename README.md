# Awesome Naming [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Concepts in Computer Science are usually nothing tangible so it's no surprise that naming things is hard.
Nevertheless, we _do_ come up with clever, creative and funny names.
Some of them so established, we never pause and admire.

This is a curated list for when naming things is done right.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

- [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) - Data structure that only supports two operations: 1) adding a single object, and 2) removing the most recently added object. Analogy to a stack of (heavy/bulky) physical objects.

## Design Patterns

## Functions

- [trampoline](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/trampoline) - Continuously runs functions which itself return functions. Like a child on a trampoline that _returns_ and bounces back up. 
- [zip](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:zip) - Merges two lists into one list of pairs like the interlocking teeth of a zipper.

## IT Security

- [Computer Virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus) - A computer program that self replicates by _infacting_ other computer programs similar to the behavior of biological viruses.
- [Trojan horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)) - Malware which misleads users of its true intent. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse. 
- [Sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)) - A save and isolated environment to test unverified programs that may contain malicious code.
- [Honeypot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)) - Part of a system meant to look like an attractive target but actually helps detect and deflect attackers.
- [Backdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)) - A method of bypassing normal authentication in a computer system.

## Software

- [uppy](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy) - A dog themed uploader component. The name is a blend of _upload_ and _puppy_. It comes with a crash recovery plugin called _golden retreiver_.

## User Interface Elements

- [Carousel](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/designing-effective-carousels/) - A kind of animated slideshow looping back on itself.
- [Breadcrumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_(navigation)) - Navigational aid allowing users to keep track of their location within programs, documents, or websites. The term is a reference to the fairy tale _Hansel and Gretel_.

## Other

- [ACID vs. BASE](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/07/06/brewer-cap-theorem-base/) - Acronyms describing competing database ideologies (aka. SQL vs. NoSQL). 
- [camelCase, snake_case, kebab-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles) - Different case styles where the name illustrates its appearance.
- [Easter egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)) - A hidden feature especially in video games in reference to an Easter egg hunt.
- [Process starvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science)) - A problem where a process is perpetually denied resources to do its work.
- [Lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation) - An evaluation stategy which suspends evaluation until it's absolutly necessary and then never does it again.
